# discord-wordart

This Discord bot can take text and turn it into 90's-style WordArt, straight out of Microsoft Word.

## Usage

Once the bot is in your server, you can run `~wa` and it'll print out some help. It's pretty straightforward.

## Credits

The actual rendering of the WordArt was pulled from [arizzitano/css3wordart](https://github.com/arizzitano/css3wordart) so if you like it, all credit to them for that part.
